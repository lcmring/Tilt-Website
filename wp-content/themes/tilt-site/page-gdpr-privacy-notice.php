We may sometimes collect additional information from third parties including former employers, credit reference agencies or other background check agencies.<p>
  <p>We will collect additional personal information in the course of job-related activities throughout the period of you working for us.</p>


<h4>How we will use information about you?</h4>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc"><p>We will only use your personal information when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal information in the following circumstances:</p>
  <li>Where we need to perform the contract we have entered into with you.</li>
  <li>Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
  <li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. </li>
</ul>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc"><p>We may also use your personal information in the following situations, which are likely to be rare:</p>
  <li>Where we need to protect your interests (or someone else's interests).</li>
  <li> Where it is needed in the public interest (or for official purposes).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Situations in which we will use your personal information</h4>

<p>We need all the categories of information in the list above (see The kind of information we hold about you) primarily to allow us to perform our contract with you and to enable us to comply with legal obligations. In some cases we may use your personal information to pursue legitimate interests of our own or those of third parties, provided your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. The situations in which we will process your personal information are listed below. </p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>Making a decision about your recruitment or appointment.</li>
  <li>Determining the terms on which you work for us.</li>
  <li>Checking you are legally entitled to work in the UK.</li>
  <li>Paying you and, if you are an employee, deducting tax and National Insurance contributions.</li>
  <li>Providing any benefits to you with your prior knowledge and consent.</li>

  <li>To conduct data analytics studies to review and better understand employee retention and attrition rates.</li>
  <li>Equal opportunities monitoring.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the above grounds for processing will overlap and there may be several grounds which justify our use of your personal information. </p>

<h4>If you fail to provide personal information</h4>

<p>If you fail to provide certain information when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have entered into with you (such as paying you or providing a benefit), or we may be prevented from complying with our legal obligations (such as to ensure the health and safety of our workers).</p>

<h4>Change of purpose</h4>

<p>We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so. </p>

<p>Please note that we may process your personal information without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>

<h4>How we use particularly sensitive personal information </h4>

<p>"Special categories" of particularly sensitive personal information require higher levels of protection. We need to have further justification for collecting, storing and using this type of personal information.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc"><p>We may process special categories of personal information in the following circumstances:</p>
  <li>In limited circumstances, with your explicit written consent.</li>
  <li>Where we need to carry out our legal obligations and in line with our data protection policy.</li>
  <li>Where it is needed in the public interest, such as for equal opportunities monitoring [or in relation to our occupational pension scheme], and in line with our data protection policy.</li>
  <li>Where it is needed to assess your working capacity on health grounds, subject to appropriate confidentiality safeguards.</li>
</ul>

<p>Less commonly, we may process this type of information where it is needed in relation to legal claims or where it is needed to protect your interests (or someone else's interests) and you are not capable of giving your consent, or where you have already made the information public. We may also process such information about members or former members in the course of legitimate business activities with the appropriate safeguards.</p>

<h4>Our obligations as an Employer</h4>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc"><p>We will use your particularly sensitive personal information in the following ways:</p>
  <li>We will use information relating to leaves of absence, which may include sickness absence or family related leaves, to comply with employment and other laws.</li>
  <li> We will use information about your physical or mental health, or disability status, to ensure your health and safety in the workplace and to assess your fitness to work, to provide appropriate workplace adjustments, to monitor and manage sickness absence and to administer benefits.</li>
  <li>We will use information about your race or national or ethnic origin, religious, philosophical or moral beliefs, or your sexual life or sexual orientation, to ensure meaningful equal opportunity monitoring and reporting.</li>
  <li>We will use trade union membership information to pay trade union premiums, register the status of a protected employee and to comply with employment law obligations.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Do we need your consent?</h4>

<p>We do not need your consent if we use special categories of your personal information in accordance with our written policy to carry out our legal obligations or exercise specific rights in the field of employment law. In limited circumstances, we may approach you for your written consent to allow us to process certain particularly sensitive data. If we do so, we will provide you with full details of the information that we would like and the reason we need it, so that you can carefully consider whether you wish to consent. You should be aware that it is not a condition of your contract with us that you agree to any request for consent from us.</p>

<h4>Information about criminal convictions</h4>

<p>We may only use information relating to criminal convictions where the law allows us to do so. This will usually be where such processing is necessary to carry out our obligations and provided we do so in line with our data protection policy.</p>

<p>Less commonly, we may use information relating to criminal convictions where it is necessary in relation to legal claims, where it is necessary to protect your interests (or someone else's interests) and you are not capable of giving your consent, or where you have already made the information public. </p>

<p>We may also process such information about members or former members in the course of legitimate business activities with the appropriate safeguards.</p>

<p>We envisage that we will hold information about criminal convictions. </p>

<p>We will only collect information about criminal convictions if it is appropriate given the nature of the role and where we are legally able to do so. Where appropriate, we will collect information about criminal convictions as part of the recruitment process or we may be notified of such information directly by you in the course of you working for us.</p>

<h4>Automated decision-making</h4>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc"><p>Automated decision-making takes place when an electronic system uses personal information to make a decision without human intervention. We are allowed to use automated decision-making in the following circumstances:</p>
  <li>Where we have notified you of the decision and given you 21 days to request a reconsideration.</li>
  <li>Where it is necessary to perform the contract with you and appropriate measures are in place to safeguard your rights.</li>
  <li>In limited circumstances, with your explicit written consent and where appropriate measures are in place to safeguard your rights.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we make an automated decision on the basis of any particularly sensitive personal information, we must have either your explicit written consent or it must be justified in the public interest, and we must also put in place appropriate measures to safeguard your rights.</p>

<p>You will not be subject to decisions that will have a significant impact on you based solely on automated decision-making, unless we have a lawful basis for doing so and we have notified you.</p>
<p>We do not envisage that any decisions will be taken about you using automated means, however we will notify you in writing if this position changes.</p>

<h4>Data sharing</h4>

<p>We may have to share your data with third parties, including third-party service providers and other entities in the group.</p>
<p>We require third parties to respect the security of your data and to treat it in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>We may transfer your personal information outside the EU.</p>
<p>If we do, you can expect a similar degree of protection in respect of your personal information.</p>

<h4>Why might you share my personal information with third parties?</h4>

  <h4>Transferring information outside the EU</h4>
    <p>We may transfer the personal information we collect about you to countries outside the EU in order to perform our contract with you.</p>
    <p>However, to ensure that your personal information does receive an adequate level of protection we have put in place the following appropriate measure[s] to ensure that your personal information is treated by those third parties in a way that is consistent with and which respects the EU and UK laws on data protection: BINDING CORPORATE RULES.

    <p>Third parties will only process your personal information on our instructions and where they have agreed to treat the information confidentially and to keep it secure.</p>

    <p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. Details of these measures may be obtained from Jonathan Malyon, Managing Director.</p>
    <p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>

  <h4>Data retention</h4>
    <h4>How long will you use my information for?</h4>
      <p>We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal information are available in our retention policy which is available from Jonathan Malyon, Managing Director, or the server. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. </p>

      <p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such information without further notice to you. Once you are no longer an employee, worker or contractor of the company we will retain and securely destroy your personal information in accordance with our data retention policy OR applicable laws and regulations.</p>

  <h4>Rights of access, correction, erasure, and restriction </h4>

      <li>Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.</li>
      <li>Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).</li>
      <li>Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.</li>
      <li>Request the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.</li>
      <li>Request the transfer of your personal information to another party. 
      If you want to review, verify, correct or request erasure of your personal information, object to the processing of your personal data, or request that we transfer a copy of your personal information to another party, please contact Jonathan Malyon in writing.</li>
    </ul>

  <h4>No fee usually required</h4>
    <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.</p>

  <h4>What we may need from you</h4>
    <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.</p>
